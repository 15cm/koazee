  koazee is a handy Golang library that makes the life easier
   when working with arrays. Arrays are understood as streams and koazee provides us a great and growing set of operations
    to deal with them. 
 
  koazee takes advantage of reflection and enforce us to make cleaner code by avoiding the use of loops and repetitive
  evaluations.
  
  Even though koazee is based on reflection, It controls the ocurred errors while manipulating the elements. This make 
  koazee a safe library to deal with arrays
  We will see it below.
